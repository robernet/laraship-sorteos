# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

These rules govern how Claude approaches every task. They reduce common LLM coding mistakes by biasing toward caution and precision over speed.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: *Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?* If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports, variables, or functions that **your changes** made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless explicitly asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria allow independent looping. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working when:** diffs have fewer unnecessary changes, there are fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Goal: Sorteos ITSON

This Laraship instance is purpose-built as a **raffle/lottery ticket sales platform** for Sorteos ITSON. All development must focus exclusively on the following functional areas:

### 1. Raffle Management (Sorteos)

- Create and configure raffles: name, dates, image, permissions.
- Define the active raffle visible to the public.
- Control raffle status: active, paused, or finished.
- Associate tickets and wallets (carteras) to the corresponding raffle.

### 2. Ticket & Wallet Inventory

- Organized in wallets (carteras) of 10 tickets each.
- Bulk wallet upload to speed up inventory management.
- Sell individual tickets or full wallets.
- Internal control of physical and digital numbering ensuring exact traceability between physical and digital inventory.

### 3. Digital Tickets (Boletos Digitales)

- Auto-generate electronic PDF tickets with a custom image, unique number, and anti-fraud QR code.
- Secure validation via a unique algorithm per ticket.
- Automatic email delivery to the buyer after payment confirmation.
- Manual resend from the admin panel when needed.

### 4. Buyers & Orders

- Full buyer data capture: name, email, phone, payment method.
- Order view with one or multiple tickets/wallets.
- Purchase history and digital delivery tracking.
- Option to resend digital tickets directly to the client.

### 5. Payments

- Payment gateway: **ClubPago** (only supported provider).
- Automatic payment confirmation and immediate digital ticket issuance.

### 6. Reports & Exports

- Advanced reports: daily, weekly, and monthly sales statistics.
- Customer reports: individual purchase history per buyer across multiple raffles.
- Geographic reports: purchase origin by city, region, or state.
- Reports by payment method and commercial performance.
- Export to CSV, Excel, or PDF.
- Key indicators: total sales, revenue, conversions, user behavior, buyer location.

### 7. Users, Roles & Security

- Role-based user management: Administrator, Operator, Support.
- Secure authentication with credential encryption.
- Role-based access control.
- Activity log for internal auditing.
- Security measures: SSL, WAF, DDoS protection, sensitive data encryption, automated backups, 24/7 active monitoring.

### 8. Automated Emails

- Email platform: **Brevo (Sendinblue)**.
- Purchase confirmation with PDF tickets attached.
- Order detail and payment method notification.
- Automatic or manual resend from the panel.
- Send history and delivery metrics (delivered, opened, bounced).

## About Laraship

Laraship is a modular Laravel-based platform by Corals for building marketplaces, e-commerce, directories, reservation, subscription, and classified sites. Modules are pluggable and dynamically registered from the database.

---

## Commands

### Frontend

- **Dev build (watch):** `npm run watch` or `npm run dev`
- **Production build:** `npm run production`
- Uses **Laravel Mix** (webpack), NOT Vite. Compiled assets land in `public/assets/`.

### Testing

- Run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`
- Run a single file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`
- Filter by name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`
- Tests use a **real database** (not SQLite in-memory) — see `phpunit.xml`.

### Custom Artisan Commands

- `php artisan corals:install` — interactive installation wizard
- `php artisan make:module {ModuleName} {MainModel} [--modal]` — scaffold a new module from the Foo template
- `php artisan corals:modules` — module manager (runs in recovery mode, minimal boot)

---

## Architecture

### Two-Tier Module System

**Core modules** (`Corals/core/`) are always loaded via `CoralServiceProvider` → `FoundationServiceProvider`. They form the framework:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Foundation` | Base controllers, DataTables, hooks, helpers, API transformers, breadcrumbs |
| `User` | Auth, roles, permissions, 2FA, social login |
| `Settings` | Application settings, module management |
| `Theme` | Multi-theme engine, view overrides per theme |
| `Activity` | Spatie activity log integration |
| `Media` | File/image management |
| `Menu` | Dynamic navigation menus |
| `Utility` | LOV (list of values), tags, categories, locations, comments, ratings, wishlists |

**Dynamic modules** (`Corals/modules/`) are registered at runtime by `ModulesServiceProvider`, which reads the `modules` DB table (`enabled=1`) and calls each module's service provider. A disabled module loads nothing.

Each module is a self-contained mini-app with its own: `routes/`, `resources/views/`, `database/migrations/`, `Models/`, `Http/Controllers/`, `DataTables/`, `Policies/`, `Transformers/`, and a `module.json` manifest.

### Key Base Classes

- `Corals\Foundation\Http\Controllers\BaseController` — extend for all admin controllers; sets theme, auth middleware, and shared view data.
- `Corals\Foundation\Http\Controllers\APIBaseController` / `APIPublicController` — for API endpoints.
- `Corals\Foundation\DataTables\BaseDataTable` — extend for all list views (Yajra DataTables).
- `Corals\Foundation\Policies\BasePolicy` — base for all model policies.
- `Corals\Foundation\View\Transformers\Transformer` — extends League Fractal; used for API resource transformation.

### WordPress-style Hook System

Two facades provide a WordPress-like event/filter system used extensively across modules:

```php
// Actions: fire-and-forget side effects
Actions::add_action('hook_name', [$this, 'method'], $priority);
Actions::dispatch('hook_name', [$arg1, $arg2]);

// Filters: transform a value through a pipeline
Filters::add_filter('hook_name', [$this, 'method'], $priority);
$value = Filters::do_filter('hook_name', $value, ...$extraArgs);
```

Use these to extend module behavior without modifying core code.

### Theme System

Themes live in `resources/themes/{theme-name}/`. The `Theme` facade resolves view paths so a theme can override any view. Admin themes are database-configurable per user session. Each theme has a `theme.json` manifest.

### Frontend Stack

- **Vue 2** + **Vuex 3** (not Vue 3)
- **Bootstrap 4** + **jQuery 3**
- **laravel-echo** + **socket.io** for real-time events
- **axios** for HTTP
- Build entry points are declared in `webpack.mix.js`

### URL IDs

Public URLs use **Hashids** for hashed IDs. Use `hashids()->encode($id)` / `hashids()->decode($hash)` rather than exposing raw integer IDs.

## Laravel Boost Guidelines

### Foundation Rules

This application is a Laravel application. Main ecosystem packages and versions:

- php — 8.3
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) — v11
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) — v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) — v4
- laravel/socialite (SOCIALITE) — v5
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) — v3
- laravel/boost (BOOST) — v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) — v0
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) — v11
- laravel-echo (ECHO) — v1
- vue (VUE) — v2

### Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. Activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain — don't wait until you're stuck.

### Conventions

- Follow all existing code conventions. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

### Verification Scripts

Don't create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality. Unit and feature tests are more important.

### Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change application dependencies without approval.

### Frontend Bundling

If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

### Documentation Files

Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

### Replies

Be concise in explanations — focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

---

## Boost Tools

- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful; ignore old entries.

### Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

**Search Syntax:**

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

### Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

### Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval; prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

---

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

---

## Laravel 11

- **CRITICAL:** Always use `search-docs` for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel 11 file structure. This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing Laravel 10 structure unless the user explicitly requests migration.

### Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/`; service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
  - Middleware registration: `app/Http/Kernel.php`
  - Exception handling: `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
  - Console commands and schedule registration: `app/Console/Kernel.php`
  - Rate limits: likely in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

### Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all attributes that were previously defined on it. Otherwise they will be dropped.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

### New Artisan Commands

- `php artisan make:enum`
- `php artisan make:class`
- `php artisan make:interface`

---

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (migrations, controllers, models, etc.).
- If creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands; also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders too. Ask the user if they need anything else, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check available options.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

For APIs, default to Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not follow this pattern — then follow existing application convention.

### URL Generation

When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, use `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` for feature tests, or pass `--unit` for unit tests. Most tests should be feature tests.

---

## PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they'd like to run the entire test suite to verify nothing is broken.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- Do not remove any tests or test files without approval. These are core to the application.

### Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- All tests: `php artisan test --compact`
- Single file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`
- Filter by name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after changing a related file)
